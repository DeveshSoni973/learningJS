          /*
          In JavaScript, when a method is used as an event listener (e.g., this.handleClick), 
          the this keyword inside the method could refer to the event target (the button element) 
          instead of the class instance, due to how event handlers work.
          
          To ensure this inside handleClick refers to the React instance 
          (so we can access this.server), the method is bound to the instance using .bind(this). 
          This creates a new function where this is always the React instance.
